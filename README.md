### How to download and run the application?
#### Run through an installer:
> 1. Install the installer.
> 2. After the installer was installed, open it.
> 3. Choose the output directory (optional) and press `Install`.
> 4. Wait for the process to finish and press `Close`.
> 5. Open the application folder.
> 6. After you do that, you should see a **`Stringify.exe`** file in that folder.
> 7. Open that **`Stringify.exe`** file. You will see a loading window with a progressbar.
> 8. After the initialization is finished, you will see the main application window.
> 11. Start using it and enjoy! ❤️
#### Run with a zipped file:
* First, you need to have a Python IDE installed to run the application. You can download the IDE [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
* Then, you need to install `pip` (Python Package Installer). You can read the tutorial to download `pip` [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).<br>
* After that, you need to install these libraries: **[tkinter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-tkinter-in-python) (tk), [customtkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/), [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (Pillow), [CTkToolTip](https://pypi.org/project/CTkToolTip/), [CTkListbox](https://pypi.org/project/CTkListbox/), [keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/), [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)**.<br>

Type in the command prompt:
```
pip install <library>
```

* After doing all the setup steps, this is how you can open and run the application file.
> 1. After downloading a `.rar` or `.zip` file, unzip and open it.
> 2. You will see a file named **`Stringify.exe`**. Open that folder.
> 4. Open that **`Stringify.py`** file. You will see a loading window with a progressbar and a black terminal.
> 7. After the initialization is finished, you will see the main application window.
> 8. Start using it and enjoy! ❤️

### FAQ (Frequently-Asked-Questions)
#### 1. Is Stringify safe?
> Based on the code, I can be confident that Stringify is safe.
#### 2. Antivirus software detected Stringify as a virus.
> Stringify uses NSIS to create the installer and PyInstaller to create the `.exe` file. They are all open-source.<br>You can check it [here](https://github.com/kichik/nsis) (NSIS) and [here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) (PyInstaller). I am confident that Stringify is completely safe and free to use.
#### 3. Which method should I use to install, zipped file or installer?
> I recommend you use an installer to install Stringify because it's more convenient and you won't need to install any Python library to use.
#### 4. Does Stringify support MacOS or Linux?
> No. Stringify only works with Window. Running Stringify on an another OS might get some features break.
